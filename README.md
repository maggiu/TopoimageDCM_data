# TopoimageDCM_data
Here, we loaded probabilistic surface and volume regions of interest (ROIs) of 44 subjects, relative to the left (LH) and right (RH) hemisphere, included in the study "Preferential signal pathways during the perception and imagery of familiar scenes: an effective connectivity study". Uploaded files are surface data including the anterior Parahippocampal Place area (aPPA), posterior Parahippocampal Place area (pPPA), the retrosplenial complex (RSC) and the Occipital Place Area (OPA). Concurrently, volume data relative to the anterior (aHC) and posterior (pHC) hippocampus on both hemispheres are also provided.
